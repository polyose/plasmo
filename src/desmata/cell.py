        A typical nix flake will copy the entire repository into the nix store

        Instead it uses hard links to place only the files that are explicitly
        listed as closure inputs into a repo of their own, and then uses that to
        build the closure.  This makes it easier to be explicit about when the
        closure should change and what it should include.

        Desmata makes it possible to share both cells and closures with your
        peers, but these two are kept separate, and are only shared if
        configured to do so.  This makes it possible to store secrets in a cell,

        If you let some bits tell you their name, they might tell you a 
        misleading one. To prevent this, Desmata instead asks you to name the 
        cell. You do this when you decide where to put it.  The parent 
        directory from desmata.py determines the cell's name.

        When referencing cells which are not on your machine, desmata prefixes
        the cell with the user's name (it's also up to you to associate names
        with the keys of users that you trust).

        So if you want to install a cell which your friend Alice has stored in
        a folder called foo, you can use `Alice.foo` to refer to it.  If your
        name is Bob, and you store it in a directory called bar, then your local
        name for the cell is Bob.bar

        If Alice is browsing cells, she will see that Alice.foo and Bob.bar are
        references to the same cell (unless one of you has since made changes
        to the cell).

        This is a strange design choice, but globally unique names are high
        value targets for corruption, and Desmata's approach to resisting
        corruption is to avoid creating high value targets in the first place.

        If you're not interested in trusting people and you'd rather trust
        package names instead, consider using pretty much any other mechanism
        for sharing data. Exploring the consequences of this design decision
        is the purpose of this project.

        A cell's "nucleus" is all of the directories that it contains.  This
        does not include the non-directory files in the cell's top level 
        directory, these are called the "membrane".  If that's an
        uncomfortable word, don't worry, it's the last biology metaphor.

        Nucleus files should be ones that are unlikely to change, even if a
        cell is shared between users.  Membrane files should be simple and
        easy to audit.

        The idea here is that if you have a nucleus which you already trust,
        browsing its membranes is a way of seeing how your peers are using that
        nucleus. Cell authors are encouraged to provide documentation
        and example usage, but the nucleus/membrane split is there so that you
        can get additional guidance from your peers.

        This also ensures that the same nucleus ends up in the hands of a wide
        variety of peers.  Auditing the contents of a nucleus may require more
        time than auding a membrane, but since nuclei change infrequently,
        their audits may benefit a wider audience.

        Desmata's philosophy here is that most people do not trust bits because
        they have audited them.  Instead, users trust bits because they trust
        somebody, who trusts somebody... who actually has audited those bits
        (perhaps this is the original author of those bits, perhaps not).  If 
        the trust graph that emerges from such a commuity of users is large and
        well connected, then users can potentially have high confidence that 
        those bits are trustworthy.

        Trust graphs like this grow informally whenever one user tells another
        user the name of a package that they like to use.  Desmata intends to
        mediate this trust more expicitly so that it can help a wider audience.

        When packages are resolved by name, there is a disconnect between
        the community trust which ensures that the named package is trustworthy,
        and the actual bits which end up on a user's machine.  Perhaps you
        installed a package with a trustworthy name, but somehow (by accident
        or by maliciousness) you ended up with bits which are not trustworthy.

        The mathy solution here is that users should communicate via
        cryptographic hashes instead of in names, but that's not how real
        humans work.  Desmata is a sort of compromise here. It gives up on
        the convenience of a globally unique name, but it also limits the degree
        to which users need to communicate in terms of cryptographc hashes.
        Instead, if Bob wants to trust Alice's packaged called foo, bob trusts
        Alice.foo.  Desmata propagates this trust in terms of public keys and 
        cryptographic hashes, but the experience remains relatively user
        friendly for Bob and Alice.

A cell on its own is unlikely to be useful. It probably needs other stuff too.

For ianstance, if the cell contains a C program, you'll likely need a C compiler
to use it. If the cell knows how to get the appropriate compiler, then the
compiler is in that cell's *closure*. This is intended to align with the concept
of a nix closure because by default desmata cells use nix for this.

Desmata aims to make it possible for you to get the right closure for your
device and to share it with peers who might need the same closure.  It also
tries to make it easier to know which closures (and which cells) are
trustworthy.

Thcere are a variety of reasons that peers may disagree about which closures
correspond with a cell. For instance, suppose that the closure uses a C
compiler to generate some machine code. If you and a peer are using devices with
differing system architectures, you will end up with different machine code.

Another reason for closure disgreement is that separate attempts to build the
same seoftware accidentally result in different bits due to the inclusion of a
timestamp or use of some nondeterministic computation by the build toolchain.
Perhaps subtle differences are introduced based on how many processor cores
or how much memory the builder has.

These differences are not hazardous on their own, but they encourage the idea
that software with the same name might legitimately be distributed via artifacts
of slightly different composition. That's a problematic idea because it
interferes with the attempts to build consensus about which closures are
trustworthy and which are malicious.

Desmata cannot identify malicious software directly, but when used by a
sufficiently vigilant community it can help you know whether you're about to
use the same software that your peers know and trust, or whether you're about
to use software that has never been seen by any of your peers before. The latter
case deserves some scrutiny, especially if you expected to be using something
repuatble.

Whether the metadata that Desmata makes available actually indicates anything
about trustworthyness depends on which peers you configure it to trust,
and whether they are actually trustworthy (and whether *their* peers are
trustworthy).
